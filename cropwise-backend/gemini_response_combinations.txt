  "analysis": "The peaty soil presents drainage challenges and requires amendments. The provided weather data is insufficient to determine the current season, which is crucial for accurate crop selection. Assuming a cool season based on the location and temperature, the suggested crops are suitable. Further soil testing and detailed weather information are recommended for optimal crop planning.",
